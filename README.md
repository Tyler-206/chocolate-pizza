*How you planned and managed your work and git workflow*

  We started off breaking the printout into sections by making notes on the paper. We figured out which HTML elements would best apply and where to break things into containers. Containers were then assigned parent or child designations.
  Then after setting up the repo, we added all of the elements into our index.html file and set up the containers. Next, we styled the file in CSS. We started at the top and worked our way down. When we found a spot that had us pushing/pulling pixels for too long, we moved on to ensure we finished on time. Then when we reached the bottom of the page, we went back to fix the spots that we could in time.
  Drew typed the HTML, Tyler typed the CSS. We made commits after the HTML was finished and again when the CSS was ready. Each of us merged the branches at least once.
